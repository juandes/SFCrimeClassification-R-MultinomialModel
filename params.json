This time using R (again).\r\n\r\nLink to the competition: [San Francisco Crime Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime)\r\n\r\n## Learning method\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe algorithm chosen for this solution, is a variation of [multinomial logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression), a classification model based on regression where the dependent variable (what we want to predict) is categorical (opposite of continuous), implemented using [neural networks](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/nnet/html/multinom.html).\r\n\r\n## Data\r\n***\r\nThe competition provides two dataset: a train data set and a test dataset. The\r\ntrain dataset is made of 878049 observations and the test dataset, of 884262\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nBoth of them contains incidents from January 1, 2003 to May 13, 2015.\r\n\r\n### Data fields\r\n\r\n* Dates : timestamp of the crime incident.\r\n* Category: Category of the incident. Also, this is the variable we want to predict.\r\nThis variable is available only in the train dataset.\r\n* Descript: A short description of the incident. This variable is available only \r\nin the train dataset.\r\n* DayOfWeek: Day of the week where the incident occurred.\r\n* PdDistrict: Police Department District\r\n* Resolution: Outcome of the incident. This variable is available only in the \r\ntrain dataset.\r\n* Address: Address of the incident.\r\n* X: Longitude\r\n* Y: Latitude","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
